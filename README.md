# The Guitar Guru's

  The Guitar Guru's website is a responsive website including all skills learnt throughout the course so far. It is a modern website that provides a service for people that are interested in the learning the guitar. It is advertised for all ages and abilities. It also offers a mixture of in person and online lessons to suit all customers.
  The website provides information to the user on what we offer, where we offer it and how we offer it. This will then give them all the information they need to decide whether or not they want to register their interest with us.

 __Home Page images__

- Keeping with the theme of black and white images on the home page. I used full width images as a background effect to break up sections to improve user experience and readability on the website.

__Overview__
  
- This section shows in a responsive grid view with icons and text. These are short and snappy bits of information to show the reader some important aspects of the Guitar Guru's and what they offer. 
- There are links located on the overview section for the locations page and the register your interest page. This means the user can navigate to other pages via this section as well as the nav bar.

  ### Locations

  - This page shows a the user all of our locations where we can teach in person. The locations are displayed in a responsive grid view with text and a background of the particular location. 
  - The grid will respond appropriately based on the screen size.

- The main "Get in Touch" button has a hover affect showing the user that is interactive.

### Features Left to Implement

- I'd like to make the locations page more interactive, taking the user to a dedicated page for the specific location they selected. This would then show them more detail around the location, including: Address, Contact Details, Tutors details. 
- Long term would have all of the online lesson material, including videos and interactive documents.
