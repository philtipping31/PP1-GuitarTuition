# The Guitar Guru's

- The Guitar Guru's website is a responsive website including all skills learnt throughout the course so far. It is a modern website that is providing a service for people that are interested in the learning the guitar. It is advertised for all ages and abilities. It also offers a mixture of in person and online lessons to suit all customers.

  - Featured on all pages, it is responsive to different screen sizes. For smaller devices the menu is located in a hamburger icon to the left, clicking this shows the drop down.
  - Larger screens will show the menu to the right in full text. 
  - The navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Locations Page, Register page and quick link to the contact us section on the footer og the home page. The nav bar is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

### Features Left to Implement

- I'd like to make the locations page more interactive, taking the user to a dedicated page for the specific location they selected. This would then show them more detail around the location, including: Address, Contact Details, Tutors details.

## Testing

- I have tested this website using Chrome Dev Tools and viewing the page on different screen sizes to ensure that the website is responsive.
  
- I deployed the page to github in the early stages to monitor any hidden issues that were not showing on the browser preview.

__Nav Bar__
  
Does the Nav Bar dropdown work on mobile devices correctly and show all content. Does the page the user is current on show as underlined.

Does the Nav Bar toggle work smoothly when looking at the site from Tablet view and smaller?

Do all links take you to the correct page and does the 'Contact Us' button, take you to the 'Contact us' section on the Home page?

__Locations__

- Does the grid view react responsively on all screen sizes. Ensuring the images and text are displayed nicely and visible.
